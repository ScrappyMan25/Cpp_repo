Small C++ Projects and coding challenges

## Project Euler
In order to learn a new language I quite like taking up coding challenges like *Project Euler* or *AdeventOfCode* that force me to use string manipulation, FileIO, and look for greedy algorythms where possible. 

This folder features a few coding PE questions as implemented by me on C++ when i just started learning C++ and i quite enjoyed myself! Featuring: 
- String manipulation
- Logical Implementations
- Multiple Implementations to try and find a greedy algorythm
- FileIO
- And more basics in c++.

## Classes
In order to further my learning of C++ i decided to look into OOP in C++ and implemented a few classes on C++ in doing so I went over:
- All implemented with simple test cases that are controlled from a switch case logic. 
- Making simple Classes and instanciating them.
- Function and Operator Overloading.
- Using Arrays with pointers.
- Template Classes
- Implementing a templete custom queue class to then queue my other custom classes.
