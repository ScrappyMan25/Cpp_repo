Small C++ Projects and coding challenges

##Project Euler
In order to learn a new language I quite like taking up coding challenges like PE or AoC that force me to use string manipulation, FileIO, and look for greedy algorythms where possible. 

This folder features a few coding PE questions as implemented by me on C++.
